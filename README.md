DTI
---

DTI, or Doing The Impossible, is a parser and interpreter for the perl 5 programming language.
DTI is based heavily on husk scheme by
[Justin Ethier](http://github.com/justinethier) and
[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)

Goal
----
The primary goal of the project is to approximate the functionality of the perl 5 interpreter.

Ideally, it will target the current release (perl-5.14.1 at the time of writing).

Many code examples were based off husk scheme and the Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours.

husk scheme is developed by [Justin Ethier](http://github.com/justinethier).

The interpreter is based on code from the book [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) written by Jonathan Tang and hosted / maintained by Wikibooks.
